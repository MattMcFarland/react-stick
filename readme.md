## Hot Reloading Gulp-Browserify React Boilerplate.

React-stick works out of the box to so you can get working on your next prototype quickly.

Its modern libraries and tools provide a highly functional base for your project with minimal startup effort.

## The bare essentials:
 - Babel 6
 - Hot Reloading
 - ExpressJS Server
 - Production-ready tooling (minification, etc)
 - Awesome dev-tooling (hot reload, watch scripts, etc)

## Quick Start

Run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MattMcFarland/react-stick.git &&
  cd react-stick && npm install && gulp
```

That's it! You should see your new app :) For more info please read on.

## Getting Started Guide

React-stick uses Gulp and Browserify instead of webpack, thanks to some
awesome libraries out there.  You can get started by downloading this repo
or by cloning it like so:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/MattMcFarland/react-stick.git myCoolApp
```

Once you have cloned the repo, navigate to the working directory of the
new application:
```
$ cd myCoolApp
```
You can now run `npm install` so you can start developing:

```
$ npm install
```

> If the installation fails, please create an [issue](https://github.com/MattMcFarland/react-stick/issues).

Once your installation is completed, run `gulp` to watch for changes:

```
$ gulp
```
